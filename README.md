I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Same as with delete, let's add edit icon.
Easy to understand for a new user and easy to implement
Same as delete - add button to row xml and add listener -

or
* Click on edit, edit image is replaced with V, edit text, click V to go back from editing mode and
save your changes.

Consistent with how it usually looks in apps.
